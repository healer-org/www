    </div>
    <div class="nine columns">
      <p><strong>Healer is a technology platform providing tools for humanitarian and missionary medical professionals to serve people who need medical care that they cannot afford.</strong></p>
      <p>Healer connects clinicians and patients electronically via case review, procedure scheduling, individual recordkeeping, and operational logistics tools.</p>
      <p>Healer was launched in 2011 in Guatemala City supporting <a href="http://operationwalk.org">Operation Walk</a>'s <a href="https://www.operationwalkmidwest.org">Midwest</a> team (then operating out of Mooresville, Indiana). Since then, it has been used on seven missions in Central America to help teams provide aid to over 500 patients receiving various corrective orthopedic surgeries such as knee and hip transplants.</p>

      <h4>Objectives</h4>

    <div class="nine columns">
      <p><strong>Our primary objective is to encourage effective and efficient medical treatment that improves overall quality of life and seeks to offset the negative effects of poverty on human health worldwide.</strong></p>
      <p>We believe this is possible in part through easy-to-use web-based software tools, and a deep understanding of how humanitarian practitioners work.</p>
      <p>While our beginnings are based in orthopedics, our goal is to be a medically neutral platform that is able to support various types of needs that patients may have.</p>

      <p>We are in the process of assembling volunteers for a core platform team. We're looking for smart web developers who are interested in APIs and front-end tooling using React or other similar technologies. Bonus points if you've got a background in medicine and health care operations. Please contact us to learn more.</p>
      <p>We are also (always) seeking mission or humanitarian groups who are interested to collaborate or pilot use of Healer technology. We would be thrilled to learn more about you too!</p>
